# Vite Pug Sass

A example [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project mixing [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

I use [vite-plugin-pug](https://github.com/SubZtep/vite-plugin-pug) for transform Pug templates into HTML.

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

Go to https://localhost:3000/ and enjoy :coffee:.
